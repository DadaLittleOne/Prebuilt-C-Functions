# Prebuilt C Functions

Prebuilt C Functions to make writing C less of a pain made by DadaLittleOne AKA Raiyaxi Ziaoi

I am a beginner to C so there may be some performance issues. If there are, feel free to make a pull request.

Please include the specfic header file that you require in your project, I have included a list of all the different header files and their uses in a seperate file labelled "Headers.md".

Note: This repository is a side project and may not be updated often. Plus most of the time I will update it when I discover a new solution to a common problem.
